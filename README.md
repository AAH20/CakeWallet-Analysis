# Disclaimer  There is a lot of discussion on the legality of decompilation. Decompiler tools have been available for a variety of platforms for a long time. Decompilers, along with other tools like debuggers, binary editors, disassemblers etc. should only be used when the owner of a program has the legal right to reverse engineer the program.
